uploadSegments(segments: string[], uploadId: string): Promise<void>

// Finalize upload and create video manifest
finalizeUpload(uploadId: string): Promise<string>
```

#### Key Features:
- ✅ Progressive video loading with instant playback
- ✅ Intelligent segment ordering (start → end → middle)
- ✅ Memory-safe local caching system
- ✅ Bandwidth-adaptive downloading
- ✅ Seamless segment combination for playback
- ✅ Background prefetching for smooth experience

#### Core Methods:
```typescript
// Prepare video for instant playback
prepareVideo(videoUrl: string, videoId: string): Promise<void>

// Start intelligent background loading
startIntelligentLoading(manifest: VideoManifest): Promise<void>

// Combine segments for seamless playback
combineSegments(videoId: string): Promise<string>

// Cleanup resources and cache
cleanup(): Promise<void>
```
