- **Your Story**: Plus icon for creation

### ðŸ“± Story Viewer (`StoryViewer.tsx`)
- **Full-screen immersive experience**
- **Progress bars** for multiple stories
- **Auto-progression** (7 seconds per story)
- **Tap navigation**: Left side = previous, right side = next
- **Swipe gestures**: Left/right for navigation, down to close
- **Real-time view tracking** with Firebase integration
- **Video and image support** with proper loading states

### ðŸ“¸ Story Creator (`StoryCreator.tsx`)
- **Gallery selection** with photo/video support
- **Beautiful gradient UI** with professional design
- **Caption input** with character counter (200 max)
- **Real-time upload** with progress indication
- **Error handling** with retry functionality

### ðŸ”¥ Firebase Integration (`firebaseService.ts`)
- **Dynamic story loading** with proper user data
- **View tracking** with `viewedBy` arrays
- **Automatic expiration** (24-hour stories)
- **User profile integration**
- **Optimized queries** for performance

### ðŸ“Š Feed Integration (`InstagramFastFeed.tsx`)
- **Story header** with horizontal scroll

- **Proper loading states** and error handling

## Technical Implementation

### Story Data Structure
```typescript
interface Story {
  id: string;
  userId: string;
  user?: User;
  mediaUrl: string;
  mediaType: 'image' | 'video' | 'photo';
  caption?: string;
  viewsCount: number;
  viewers: string[];
  viewedBy: string[]; // New field for tracking views
  isViewed?: boolean; // Computed for current user
  createdAt: string;
  expiresAt: string;
}
```

### Key Methods
1. **`getStories()`**: Loads stories with viewing state for current user
2. **`createStory()`**: Creates new story with proper metadata
3. **`markStoryAsViewed()`**: Updates viewing state in real-time
4. **`viewStory()`**: Increments view count and tracks viewers

## User Flow

### Creating a Story
1. Tap "Your Story" button
2. Beautiful gradient selection screen appears
3. Choose photo/video from gallery
4. Add optional caption (up to 200 characters)
5. Tap "Share Story" to upload
6. Real-time progress with error handling

### Viewing Stories
1. Tap any story with rainbow border (unviewed)
2. Full-screen viewer with progress bars
3. Auto-progression or manual navigation
4. Story automatically marked as viewed
5. Border turns grey on return to feed

### Navigation Controls

- **Tap right half**: Next story  
- **Swipe down**: Close viewer
- **Swipe left/right**: Navigate stories

## Performance Optimizations

### ðŸš€ Speed Enhancements
