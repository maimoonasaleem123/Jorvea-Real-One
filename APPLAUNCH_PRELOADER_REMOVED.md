1. ❌ Slower app launch time
2. ❌ Firestore query error: "Invalid Query. A non-empty array is required for 'in' filters"
3. ❌ Unnecessary background processing on app startup
4. ❌ Potential performance impact on low-end devices

## 🔧 Solution Applied

### **Removed AppLaunchReelPreloader**

**Result:**
- ✅ Faster app startup
- ✅ No Firestore query errors on launch
- ✅ Cleaner initialization flow

#### 2. ReelsScreen.tsx
**Removed:**
- ❌ Import of `AppLaunchReelPreloader`
- ❌ Check for preloaded reel
- ❌ Complex preloaded reel logic with background loading

**Kept:**

- ✅ Fast reel fetching when tab is opened
- ✅ Background video preparation
- ✅ 50ms buffer config for instant playback

## 🚀 Current Reel Loading Strategy

### **How It Works Now:**

```
1. User Opens App
   └─> Fast initialization (no reel preloading)
   └─> App opens instantly ⚡

2. User Taps Reels Tab
   └─> InstantReelsPreloader.getInstantReels(userId, 5)
   └─> Loads 5 reels from cache/Firestore
   └─> Displays immediately
   └─> Videos prepared in background

3. User Watches Reels
   └─> Additional reels load dynamically
   └─> Background video preparation
   └─> Smooth infinite scroll
```
