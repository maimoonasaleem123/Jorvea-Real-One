## 🔥 FIREBASE STRUCTURE

### New Collections:

#### `reelViews`
```
/{userId}_{reelId}_{deviceId}
{
  userId, reelId, deviceId,
  timestamp, watchTime,
  isValid, userAgent, appVersion
}
```

#### `userInteractions`
```
/{userId}_{reelId}
{
  action: 'viewed'|'liked'|'commented'|'shared'|'skipped',
  timestamp, watchTime
}
```

#### `reels` (Updated)
```
{
  views: number,
  uniqueViewers: string[],
  lastViewedAt: Timestamp
}
```

## 🚀 HOW IT WORKS

### View Tracking Flow:
```
User watches 3s → Check cache → Not viewed? → Bot check → Track view → Update Firebase → Cache locally → Never show again
```

### Feed Generation:
```
Initialize → Load preferences → 40% followed + 30% trending + 20% interests + 10% discovery → Shuffle → Filter viewed → Return unique feed
```
