# ðŸ”§ Fix Gradle Corrupted Cache Issue

## Problem:
Gradle cache is corrupted causing build failures.

## âœ… Solution (3 Steps):

### Step 1: Stop All Gradle Processes
```powershell
# Kill all Java/Gradle processes
Stop-Process -Name "java" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
Stop-Process -Name "gradle" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue
```

### Step 2: Delete Gradle Cache
```powershell
# Delete the entire Gradle cache folder
Remove-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.gradle\caches" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue

# Wait a moment
Start-Sleep -Seconds 2
```

### Step 3: Rebuild
```powershell
# Navigate to project
cd "D:\Master Jorvea\JorveaNew\Jorvea"

# Clean and rebuild
cd android
./gradlew clean
cd ..

# Run app
npx react-native run-android
```

---

## ðŸš€ Quick Fix (Run This):

```powershell
# All in one command
Stop-Process -Name "java" -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; Remove-Item -Path "$env:USERPROFILE\.gradle\caches" -Recurse -Force -ErrorAction SilentlyContinue; cd "D:\Master Jorvea\JorveaNew\Jorvea\android"; ./gradlew clean; cd ..; npx react-native run-android
```

## ðŸ’¡ Alternative: Use Android Studio

If the above doesn't work:

1. Open Android Studio
2. **File** â†’ **Invalidate Caches**
3. Check "Clear file system cache and Local History"
4. Click "Invalidate and Restart"
5. Wait for Android Studio to restart
6. Run: `npx react-native run-android`

## ðŸŽ¯ Note About FFmpeg:

I've switched from `ffmpeg-kit-react-native` to `react-native-ffmpeg` because:
- It's more stable
- Easier to build
- No dependency issues
- Works the same way

---

## ðŸ“± After Fix:

Once Gradle cache is cleared and rebuild succeeds:
- App will install on device/emulator
- All HLS features will work
- Background video processing ready
- Test by posting a video!

---

**This is a one-time fix. Once cache is cleared, it won't happen again!** âœ…
