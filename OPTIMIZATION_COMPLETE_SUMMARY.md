2. Or replace `HomeScreen.tsx` content with `FastHomeScreen.tsx`

### Delete Service
Already integrated in FastHomeScreen. To add to other screens:

```typescript
import ComprehensiveDeleteService from '../services/ComprehensiveDeleteService';

const deleteService = ComprehensiveDeleteService.getInstance();

// Delete post
await deleteService.confirmAndDeletePost(postId, userId);

// Delete reel
await deleteService.confirmAndDeleteReel(reelId, userId);

// Delete story
await deleteService.confirmAndDeleteStory(storyId, userId);
```

See `DELETE_SERVICE_INTEGRATION_GUIDE.md` for complete examples.

## 🧪 TESTING

### Build the app:
```bash
cd android
./gradlew clean
./gradlew assembleRelease
adb install -r app/build/outputs/apk/release/app-release.apk
```

### Monitor performance:
